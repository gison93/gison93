# Hi! Iâ€™m NicolÃ²ðŸ‘‹

You can call me Nick or Nico if you don't like accents.

## Work

I am a:

```python
for role in ["scientist", "engineer", "person"]:
    print(f"- Data {role}") 
```
Basically I use statistics and Python to extract business value and ~~create~~ solve problems.

## Out of Office

When I am not wrangling data with Python, I am probably:

* spending quality time with my wife & family
* hanging out with my friends
* reading good books
* making memes

To sum everything up:

## Side Projects

[Personal blog](https://www.nicologiso.com/) where I publish posts related to [data science and programming](https://www.nicologiso.com/tech/) but also [non technical stuff](https://www.nicologiso.com/essays/).

[While Model Trains](https://whilemodeltrains.com/) is a web app offering a productive alternative to mindless social media scrolling while your model trains. It presents 3 blog posts about data/AI/ML, and if none of the 3 captures your interest, you can simply click a button to get new articles until you find one to read.

[Italian Art Bot](https://bsky.app/profile/italianartbot.bsky.social) is a Python bot that posts images of Italian paintings on the social platform Bluesky 3 times per day.
